# habit-tracker

The intention for creating this habit tracker was to keep track of my daily goals and also build something practical while learning through the process. The app is created through use of React, Webpack, Local Storage, and Sass.

The functionality and process of going through the app is:
1. the user will click the add symbol

2. The user will then create a new habit when they click the add button:

3. Users are able to increment their habit goal throughout the day and are able to delete their habits. When the user reaches the end of their milestone, they will be asked to reset their progress and will be shown a counter of how many times they have completed the bar.
